# Description

Building a **spam email binary classifier** based on dataset from FreeCodeCamp https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/neural-network-sms-text-classifier.

# ML model

The entire pipeline is written in `_manual.ipynb` file. First, the data is preprocessed using manually-written Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach. A vocabulary of 1000 words is constructed from the training dataset. The algorithm of Logistic Regression is used to train a binary classifier model on the BoW-processed dataset.
